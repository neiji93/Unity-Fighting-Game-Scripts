# Unity-Fighting-Game-Scripts
There were a repository that I investigated and found interesting. I will clone the repository if I find it and then share it with you. So, now, don't clone this link unless you have to keep an eye on it. The scripts use coroutines to modelize a fighting game with 3 type of attacks (Combos, super attacks, regular attacks and defense).
